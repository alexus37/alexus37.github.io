  A small code base has already been written for you. In particular, we
  provide you with the interface, as well as a basic vector library.
  
  The "data" folder and the files "read_obj.js" and "read_tga.js" are only used in Exercise 2, so don't worry about them for Exercise 1.
  
  To run the framework, you need to start raytracer.html in your browser (recent versions of Firefox and Chrome are supported, don't use IE)
  
  We recommend you to take a look at the code and read through the comments. You can start coding in "src/raytracer.js"

  To export your rendered images as PNG, just click Export. It will download the image.



  This module encapsulates some basic features of a ray tracer. The current scene is a big red sphere and a small blue sphere.
  To run the different moduls, send the ID as a GET parameter (An example execution to run module B2: raytracer.html?B2)
